# Fishnet Quick Start Project

This is a companion project to the [written guide on GitBook](https://worldsalad.gitbook.io/fishnet-quickstart/).

###[https://worldsalad.gitbook.io/fishnet-quickstart/](https://worldsalad.gitbook.io/fishnet-quickstart/)

It covers:

* Basic scene setup
* Player Movement

Coming soon:

* Syncing Data
* Network calls
* Flowing between scenes

[The Quickstart](https://worldsalad.gitbook.io/fishnet-quickstart/) assumes you are starting with a blank/default new project and following along.  The example project here was created with those instructions followed that you can clone and compare to what you have made for troubleshooting purposes or to just look at if that is how you learn.
